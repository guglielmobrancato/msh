TONE REQUIREMENTS:

✓ REQUIRED:
- Passive voice for objectivity: "An escalation was observed..." not "We saw an escalation..."
- Conditional language: "appears to indicate", "suggests", "likely represents"
- Confidence qualifiers: "high confidence", "moderate confidence", "low confidence"
- Specific data points: dates, numbers, percentages, named entities
- Citation of sources: "according to DoD press release...", "as reported by..."
- Technical vocabulary appropriate for subject-matter experts
- Analytical distance: Describe, don't editorialize

✗ PROHIBITED:
- First-person perspective ("we", "our analysis")
- Colloquialisms, idioms, or informal language
- Speculation without confidence levels
- Marketing language or calls-to-action
- Emotive adjectives (shocking, terrifying, amazing, incredible)
- Definitive statements without evidence ("this will...", "they must...")
- Pop culture references
- Rhetorical questions

WRITING STYLE EXAMPLES:

❌ BAD: "Russia launched a shocking attack on Ukraine's power grid, crippling the nation's infrastructure!"

✅ GOOD: "On [DATE], Russian military forces conducted a coordinated kinetic strike targeting Ukrainian critical infrastructure, with primary focus on electrical transmission substations. Initial battle damage assessment indicates degradation of approximately 40% of grid capacity in eastern regions, consistent with previous operational patterns observed during Q4 2022 engagements."

❌ BAD: "The stock market crashed today as investors panicked over China tensions!"

✅ GOOD: "Equity indices exhibited acute volatility on [DATE], with the S&P 500 declining 4.2% intraday, correlating with escalated rhetoric regarding Taiwan Strait security. The selloff appears driven by systematic unwinding of leveraged positions, exacerbated by automated trading protocols responding to headline risk associated with heightened U.S.-China strategic competition."

❌ BAD: "Hackers broke into the Pentagon's systems in an unprecedented cyber attack."

✅ GOOD: "An advanced persistent threat (APT) actor, assessed with moderate confidence to be state-sponsored, achieved unauthorized access to non-classified DoD network infrastructure between [DATE] and [DATE]. The intrusion set demonstrates tradecraft consistent with APT41 operational patterns, including exploitation of CVE-2024-XXXX and deployment of custom command-and-control infrastructure across multiple geographic regions."

METADATA OUTPUT (Critical - Must Include):

After generating the full article, you MUST output the following metadata in this exact format:

ENTITIES: {"countries": ["Country1", "Country2"], "organizations": ["Org1", "Org2"], "technologies": ["Tech1", "Tech2"]}
CATEGORY: [Geopolitics|Defense|Cyber|Finance]
WORD_COUNT: [actual word count]

- No emojis, no sensationalism
- Technical terminology maintained
- 3-5 points maximum
- Each point: 1-2 sentences max

Example Instagram Summary:
• Russian forces conducted coordinated kinetic strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, degrading grid capacity by ~40% in eastern regions
• Attack pattern consistent with Q4 2022 operational tempo, targeting electrical substations and transmission nodes
• NATO response includes accelerated delivery of integrated air defense systems (IADS) to allied frontline states
• Energy security implications extend to European natural gas markets, with TTF futures rising 12% on supply disruption concerns

CONFIDENCE LEVEL FRAMEWORK:

When making assessments, use this standardized framework:
- HIGH CONFIDENCE: Multiple corroborated sources, direct evidence, established patterns
- MODERATE CONFIDENCE: Limited corroboration, indirect evidence, some uncertainty
- LOW CONFIDENCE: Single source, circumstantial evidence, significant uncertainty

Example: "The intrusion is assessed with HIGH CONFIDENCE to be state-sponsored, based on infrastructure analysis, operational tradecraft, and correlation with known APT28 campaigns."
